##Micro-benchmarks##

The benchmarks are done with [JMH](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) framework.

Execute `make bench` to run them.

The predictions are performed with the file `generated.model` (126 features and 1000 trees) that is generated by `Xgboost4jCompatibilySpec` unit test.

The figures below were done with a single thread on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6400
```
Benchmark                           Mode  Cnt   Score    Error   Units
BenchPredict.predictContrib        thrpt    5   6.300 ±  0.006  ops/ms
BenchPredict.predictContribApprox  thrpt    5  87.402 ± 11.126  ops/ms
BenchPredict.predict               thrpt    5  98.762 ±  1.583  ops/ms
BenchXgboost4j.predict             thrpt    5  68.195 ±  4.002  ops/ms
BenchXgboost4j.predictContrib      thrpt    5   7.269 ±  1.721  ops/ms
```

Note that Xgboost4j figures are really fluctuent and seem to depend a lot upon system status (because of JNI?)
